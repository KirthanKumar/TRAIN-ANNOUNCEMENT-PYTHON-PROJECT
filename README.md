# TRAIN-ANNOUNCEMENT-PYTHON-PROJECT
This is a project where the hindi and english announcements of trains are generated by slicing some info from railway.mp3 audio and other info by converting text to speech using gtts module. These texts are extracted from .xls file using pandas module. The necessary mp3 files are merged using pybub (audioSegment) module.
